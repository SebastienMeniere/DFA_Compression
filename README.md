# DFA_Compression
Deterministic Finite Automata for  Image Compression and Decompression
This project compresses and decompresses pure black and white images into text files representing their Finite Automata, and vice versa. The project also includes funtion that allow the user to losslessly reduce black and white images to half their size. As well as, increasing the size of an image using seripinski triangle magnification and a checkerboard magnification.
